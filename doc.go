/*
Package Package dotquote serializes data into the "dotquote" format.

The "dotquote" format is a more human-readable for a list of namespaced key-valued pairs.

The "dotquote" format is also useful for fitting your entire data on a single line of text.

Example

	"app"."name"="myapi" "app"."build"."number"="23" "apple"="one" "banana"="two" "cherry"="three" "trace"."id"="DtehCQqBnw93Tw4h"
